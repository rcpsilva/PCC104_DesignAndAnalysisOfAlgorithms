\title{Understanding the Implementation of Basic Data Structures in Python}
\begin{document}
\maketitle

If you're curious to see \textbf{how basic data structures like lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples are implemented in Python}, there are a few ways to explore this depending on how deep you want to go:

\section*{1. Quick Info via \texttt{help()} or \texttt{\_\_doc\_\_}}
You won’t see the full implementation, but you’ll get a summary of how it works.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
help(list)
help(dict)
\end{lstlisting}

\section*{2. Browse the CPython Source Code (Actual Implementation)}

Python’s most widely used implementation is \textbf{CPython}, and most of the core data structures are written in \textbf{C} for performance.

You can browse the source code here: \url{https://github.com/python/cpython}

\subsection*{Key files:}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2cm]
  \item[\texttt{list}] \href{https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Objects/listobject.c}{listobject.c}
  \item[\texttt{dict}] \href{https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Objects/dictobject.c}{dictobject.c}
  \item[\texttt{set}] \href{https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Objects/setobject.c}{setobject.c}
  \item[\texttt{tuple}] \href{https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Objects/tupleobject.c}{tupleobject.c}
  \item[\texttt{str}] \href{https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Objects/unicodeobject.c}{unicodeobject.c}
\end{itemize}

\section*{3. Use the \texttt{collections} Module for Higher-Level Structures}

Some data structures like \texttt{deque}, \texttt{defaultdict}, and \texttt{OrderedDict} are implemented in Python or C extensions.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
from collections import deque
help(deque)
\end{lstlisting}

You can find their implementation in:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Lib/collections/__init__.py}{collections/\_\_init\_\_.py}
  \item \href{https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Modules/_collectionsmodule.c}{\_collectionsmodule.c (C backend)}
\end{itemize}

\section*{4. Use Pure Python Versions (For Educational Purposes)}

There are many educational re-implementations of Python data structures in pure Python online. For instance:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \href{https://github.com/trekhleb/py-algorithms}{cpython-data-structures on GitHub} – great for understanding the logic behind them.
\end{itemize}

Would you like to see a simplified Python version of, say, a \texttt{list} or \texttt{dict}?
